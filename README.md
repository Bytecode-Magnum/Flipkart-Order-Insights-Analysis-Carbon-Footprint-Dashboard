## Project Overview

This project is a data analysis initiative that provides insights into customer behavior and preferences based on Flipkart order data. It involves exploring and understanding the patterns of delivered, refunded, and canceled orders, as well as estimating the carbon footprint associated with these orders. The project culminates in the creation of an interactive dashboard for data visualization.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in this project:
- **Python**: For data analysis, scripting, and dashboard development.
- **Selenium**: For web scraping Flipkart order data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly Dash**: For creating the interactive data dashboard.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting code and analysis.

## [Data Collection](https://github.com/Bytecode-Magnum/Flipkart-Order-Insights-Analysis-Carbon-Footprint-Dashboard/blob/main/Flipkart%20Order%20List%20Data%20Mining.ipynb)

The data collection phase involves the use of the Selenium web scraping tool to retrieve order data from Flipkart. This data includes various aspects of customer orders, such as product details, customer information, order status, and more.

## [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/Bytecode-Magnum/Flipkart-Order-Insights-Analysis-Carbon-Footprint-Dashboard/blob/main/Flipkart%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)

To ensure the data's quality and consistency, the data cleaning process is performed. This involves handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and eliminating any irrelevant or redundant information. Clean data forms the foundation for accurate analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the heart of the project. It involves in-depth analysis of the collected data. Various EDA techniques, including order frequency, order value distribution, customer segmentation, and more, are applied to uncover valuable insights into customer behavior and shopping patterns.

## Average Carbon Footprint Calculation

In an effort to address environmental concerns, the project includes an analysis of the carbon footprint associated with the ordered products. Carbon emissions are estimated for each order, and the results are used to calculate the average carbon footprint.

## [Interactive Data Dashboard](https://github.com/Bytecode-Magnum/Flipkart-Order-Insights-Analysis-Carbon-Footprint-Dashboard/blob/main/Create_DashBoard.py)

To make the findings accessible and visually engaging, an interactive data dashboard is created using Plotly Dash. The dashboard offers a user-friendly platform for exploring the project's insights, allowing for dynamic visualizations and data exploration.
